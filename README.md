Data Analysis in Spotify Dataframe 2017-2021

1. Cleaning Process
    - Explore the dataset.
    - The important emelents are 6, so i must breakdown the first column.
    - Then i must isolate the elements so i can use them for my analysis.
    - But first i must try clean my dataset and drop as little information as possible.
    - So important categories are separated by # and their length must be 6. I always check their length and           make adjustments.
    - When my lists of 6 elements are ready, i separate them and i transform them so they can be useful for my         analysis. Their indeces in lists are all the same so it's easy to breakdown the lists.
    - At last, i keep only the columns that i will need for analysis and i create a new column of lists which         consists of the genres of each song. It's necessary for analysis phase.
    - Let's proceed!
